## 🧠 What I Did

My main contribution was developing the JavaScript logic that powers interactivity, data handling, and map integration. 
- Added a sort button and a delete button that successfully deletes all of the workouts
- Added an individual delete button for each workout displayed
- Incorporated a visual alert message if website cannot access the users location
